Batch Channel Extraction Script Changelog
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019/12/24 - v2.0.0

Major code revision, new features and interface update

- The script now reflects the same flexibility of the ChannelExtraction process
  allowing to choose any number of color channels form any color space.

- The interface has been completely redesigned.

- FITS header FILTER is now optionally saved depending on a settings checkbox.

- Code has been entirely revised.

- ### TODO: This script still needs a major code revision (e.g., don't use
            deprecated with() structs, UI layout issues, etc).

- ### TODO: UI code can still be improved by removing deleted channel groups
            instead of just hiding them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2018/12/27 - v1.2.4

Maintenance modifications by PTeam staff:

- The script was failing when not all channels were selected; see bug report:
      https://pixinsight.com/forum/index.php?topic=13050.0

- The script was using an obsolete way to measure execution time. It has been
  replaced with much simpler code based on the ElapsedTime core PJSR object.

- ### TODO: This script requires a complete code revision.
