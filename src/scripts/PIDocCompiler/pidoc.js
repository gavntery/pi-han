#feature-id    Development > Documentation Compiler

#feature-info  PixInsight Documentation Compiler. This script parses a PIDoc source file and generates an \
   HTML5/XHTML document integrated with a target PixInsight reference documentation system.<br/>\
   <br/>\
   PIDoc is a powerful markup language to generate PixInsight documentation easily and efficiently. \
   By writing their documentation in the PIDoc language, developers on the PixInsight platform can concentrate \
   exclusively on documentation contents, without having to think on the appearance of their documents. The \
   documentation compiler automatically generates correctly structured and organized documents that integrate \
   seamlessly with the PixInsight reference documentation system.<br/>\
